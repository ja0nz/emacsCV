* Git secret
Git secret is used to encrypt [[file:cv/secrets.secret]]
This file can be used for private information that you don't want to store in a public repo like
#+begin_src org
#+mobile: <123>
#+address: <street>
#+end_src

In order to populate your information into secrets and encrypt them run:
#+begin_src sh
git secret clean # Remove secrets files
rm -rf .gitsecret/keys/* # Remove all old keys
git secret tell your@email # Connect to your gpg keys via email uid
# <edit cv/secrets>
git secret hide -m
#+end_src

Memo to you & myself - on cloning the repo somewhere new you need to reveal the secrets:
#+begin_src sh
git secret reveal
#+end_src
